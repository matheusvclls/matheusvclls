I am a Brazilian-based Data Engineer with 7 years working with data and programming. I have extensive experience designing end-to-end solutions from talking with business areas, designing the architecture, building ETL pipelines, algorithms, databases until drawing the dashboards. I currently work as a data engineer at a fintech company.
